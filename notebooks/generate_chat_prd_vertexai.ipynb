Threads allows users to create private groups with up to 30 people, and each group can have its own chat thread. Users can post photos, videos, and text messages in their groups, and they can also see when other members of the group are online.\n",
       "\n",
       "Instagram Threads is different from other social media platforms in that it is designed for private communication. Users can share their thoughts and ideas with a smaller group of people who they trust, and they can be sure that their content will not be seen by a wider audience. This makes Instagram Threads a good choice for users who want to have a more intimate and personal online experience.\n",

       "## Target Audience and Stakeholders\n",
       "\n",
       "The target audience for Instagram Threads is young adults who are active on social media. These users are looking for a way to share their thoughts and ideas with a smaller group of people, and they want to be sure that their content will not be seen by a wider audience.\n",

       "\n",
       "Instagram Threads fills a gap in the market for a social media platform that allows users to share their thoughts and ideas with a smaller group of people. Other social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, are designed for sharing content with a wider audience. This can make it difficult for users to share personal or private information without worrying about it being seen by people they do not know. Instagram Threads solves this problem by allowing users to create private groups with up to 30 people. This means that users can be sure that their content will only be seen by the people they choose.\n",
       "\n",
       "Instagram Threads also offers a number of features that other social media platforms do not offer. For example, users can see when other members of their group are online, and they can send direct messages to each other.
