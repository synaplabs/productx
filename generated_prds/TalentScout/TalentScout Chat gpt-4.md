# TalentScout: A Sports Analytics Product

## Product Overview

**TalentScout** is a revolutionary sports analytics product designed to bridge the gap between raw talent and professional sports. It leverages advanced technologies like Graph Neural Networks to analyze lower division statistics, team information, teammates' data, ground conditions, and weather information to predict a player's potential performance at higher levels of sports, including national and international platforms.

The purpose of TalentScout is to provide a comprehensive, data-driven approach to talent scouting. It aims to democratize the talent identification process, making it less reliant on subjective judgments and more on quantifiable metrics. This product is not limited by geography, age, or gender, making it a truly global platform for talent identification.

The target audience for TalentScout includes:

- **Coaches**: To identify potential players for their teams.
- **Analysts**: To provide data-backed insights about upcoming talents.
- **Team Managers and Owners**: To make informed decisions about player recruitment.

The rationale behind choosing this group as the target audience is their direct involvement in the talent scouting process. They are the ones who can benefit the most from accurate, data-driven insights about player performance and potential.

TalentScout fills a significant gap in the market by providing a platform that uses advanced analytics to predict player performance. While there are products that provide sports analytics, none of them focus on predicting a player's performance at higher levels based on their lower division data. This unique proposition makes TalentScout stand out in the market and provides a compelling reason for users to choose it over other products.

## Product Objectives

The primary objective of TalentScout is to revolutionize the talent scouting process in sports by leveraging advanced analytics. This aligns well with the company's broader objective of driving innovation in sports through technology. The company has always been at the forefront of using technology to solve complex problems in sports, and TalentScout is a testament to this commitment.

The business model of TalentScout also aligns with the company's model. The company has always believed in creating value through data and analytics, and TalentScout is built on this principle. It uses data from lower division games to generate valuable insights that can help in talent identification. This not only creates value for the users but also opens up new revenue streams for the company through subscription fees or partnerships with sports organizations.

TalentScout can help the company achieve several goals:

- **Attracting Customers**: By offering a unique product that fills a significant gap in the market, the company can attract a new segment of customers, including coaches, analysts, and team managers.
- **Generating Profits**: With a potential to attract a large user base, TalentScout can generate significant profits through subscription fees. Additionally, the company can also monetize the data generated by the product.
- **Promoting Goodwill**: By democratizing the talent scouting process, the company can promote its goodwill among sports communities. This can enhance the company's reputation and strengthen its brand.

TalentScout achieves these goals by providing a platform that not only solves a critical problem in sports but also aligns with the company's mission and business model. It leverages the company's strengths in data and analytics to create a product that can change the way talent is identified in sports.

## Market Research

### Current Competitors:

1. **Sports Insights**: A well-established sports analytics platform that provides data and insights for various sports. However, it primarily focuses on betting analytics and does not offer predictive analytics for talent scouting.

2. **Catapult Sports**: Offers performance analytics for teams and athletes. While it provides in-depth data, it does not specifically focus on talent scouting or predicting performance at higher levels based on lower division data.

### Potential Competitors:

1. **Edge10**: Currently in its development phase, Edge10 aims to provide comprehensive sports analytics. However, it is unclear whether it will include predictive analytics for talent scouting.

2. **SAP Sports One**: While primarily a team management software, it has the potential to expand into sports analytics and could become a competitor if it decides to include predictive analytics for talent scouting.

The major difference between TalentScout and its competitors is its unique focus on predicting a player's performance at higher levels based on their lower division data. While other products provide sports analytics, none of them specifically address this aspect, giving TalentScout a unique edge.

In terms of target customers, TalentScout caters to a more specific audience - those involved in the talent scouting process. This includes coaches, analysts, and team managers. Competitor products, on the other hand, cater to a broader audience, including bettors, athletes, and general sports enthusiasts.

TalentScout aligns well with current trends and user expectations. With the increasing use of data in sports, there is a growing demand for more sophisticated analytics tools. TalentScout meets this demand by providing advanced predictive analytics for talent scouting. To further meet user expectations, the product should include features like user-friendly data visualization tools, real-time updates, and customizable reports.

## Launch Strategy

### US vs International Markets:

The US market is a significant market for sports analytics products due to the popularity of various sports and the widespread use of analytics in sports management. However, TalentScout is a global product, and its potential is not limited to the US. International markets, especially countries with a strong sports culture like the UK, Australia, India, and Brazil, also present significant opportunities.

### Customer Demographic:

TalentScout is primarily for professionals involved in the talent scouting process in sports. This includes coaches, analysts, and team managers. The product is also suitable for sports organizations and clubs looking for a data-driven approach to talent identification.

### Launch Strategy:

Given the global potential of TalentScout, the product should be launched simultaneously in the US and key international markets. The launch should be accompanied by a comprehensive marketing campaign that highlights the unique features of the product and its benefits for the target audience.

The marketing campaign should include:

- **Online Advertising**: Use platforms like Google AdWords and social media to reach a global audience.
- **Partnerships**: Partner with sports organizations and clubs to promote the product.
- **Influencer Marketing**: Collaborate with well-known sports personalities to endorse the product.

### TAM vs SAM vs SOM:

- **TAM (Total Available Market)**: The total market for sports analytics products is estimated to be around $4.6 billion globally. This represents the total demand for such products.

- **SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**: Given that TalentScout is primarily targeted at professionals involved in the talent scouting process, the SAM would be a subset of the TAM. Assuming that around 20% of the TAM is involved in talent scouting, the SAM would be around $920 million.

- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: The SOM is the portion of the SAM that TalentScout can realistically capture. Assuming that TalentScout can capture around 10% of the SAM in the first few years, the SOM would be around $92 million.
