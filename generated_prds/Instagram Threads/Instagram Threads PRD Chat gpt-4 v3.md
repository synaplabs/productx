# Product Requirement Document for Instagram Threads

## Product Overview

The purpose of Instagram Threads is to provide a platform for users to share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences in a concise, tweet-like format. This feature aims to fill the gap in Instagram's current offerings by providing a more text-focused sharing option, as opposed to the image and video-centric content that Instagram is known for.

The scope of this product is global, catering to users across different age groups, genders, and geographies. For instance, a 20-year-old college student from India (A) might use Instagram Threads to share quick thoughts about their day or opinions on trending topics. A 40-year-old working professional from the US (B) might use it to share industry insights or professional advice. A 60-year-old retired person from the UK (C) might use it to share life experiences or thoughts on current events.

The rationale behind targeting such a diverse audience is that Instagram Threads can be used by anyone who has something to say and wants to share it with their followers. It's not limited to a specific type of content or user, making it a versatile addition to Instagram's features.

The product is different from other similar products in that it combines the brevity of Twitter with the visual appeal and user base of Instagram. It's better in the sense that it allows users to express themselves in a new way on a platform they're already familiar with, without having to build a following on a different platform.

The stakeholders for this product include the users who will be using the feature, the Instagram team who will be developing and maintaining it, and the advertisers who might use the feature to reach their target audience.

## Product Objectives

The product objectives of Instagram Threads align well with the overarching objectives of Instagram and its parent company, Facebook. Both companies aim to foster community, encourage sharing, and provide a platform for self-expression. Instagram Threads, with its focus on text-based sharing, aligns with these objectives by offering a new way for users to express themselves and share their thoughts.

The business models of Instagram and Instagram Threads also match. Instagram's business model is based on user engagement and advertising. The more users engage with the platform, the more valuable it becomes to advertisers. Instagram Threads can contribute to this model by increasing user engagement. The new feature could attract users who prefer text-based sharing over visual content, thereby increasing the overall user base and engagement.

Instagram Threads can help achieve several company goals. Firstly, it can attract new users to the platform, particularly those who prefer text-based content. This could increase Instagram's user base and, by extension, its advertising revenue. Secondly, it can increase user engagement by providing a new way for users to interact with the platform. This could make Instagram more attractive to advertisers, further boosting revenue. Lastly, by offering a new feature that is not available on other similar platforms, Instagram can enhance its reputation as an innovative company, promoting goodwill and strengthening its brand.

Instagram Threads would achieve these goals by providing a unique, engaging feature that encourages users to spend more time on the platform and share more content. This increased engagement would make the platform more attractive to advertisers, leading to increased ad revenue. Additionally, by offering a feature that is not available on other platforms, Instagram can differentiate itself from its competitors and strengthen its brand.

## Market Research

Current competitors for Instagram Threads include Twitter and Facebook's own status updates. Twitter is a well-established platform for sharing brief, text-based content, while Facebook's status updates allow users to share text-based content with their friends and followers.

Potential competitors could include any new social media platforms that focus on text-based content sharing. For instance, platforms like Mastodon or Parler, which are still gaining traction, could potentially compete with Instagram Threads.

The major difference between Instagram Threads and its competitors is the integration with Instagram's existing platform. Unlike Twitter or Facebook, Instagram Threads allows users to share text-based content within the same platform where they share photos and videos. This seamless integration could make Instagram Threads more appealing to users who prefer to keep all their social media activity in one place.

In terms of target customers, Twitter tends to attract users who are interested in news, politics, and professional networking, while Facebook's user base is more diverse. Instagram Threads, with its integration with Instagram, could attract a younger, more visually-oriented user base.

In terms of current trends and user expectations, Instagram Threads aligns well with the trend towards more concise, real-time content sharing. Users today expect to be able to share their thoughts and experiences as they happen, and Instagram Threads provides a platform for them to do so.

To meet these trends and expectations, Instagram Threads should include features that facilitate real-time sharing, such as the ability to post threads directly from the Instagram app, and the ability to tag other users in threads. It should also include features that make it easy for users to discover and engage with threads, such as a dedicated threads feed and the ability to like, comment on, and share threads.

To collect user inputs and use user data to improve the product, Instagram could implement features like user surveys and feedback forms. They could also track user engagement with threads (e.g., likes, comments, shares) to identify popular content and trends. This data could be used to refine the thread recommendation algorithm, improve the user interface, and develop new features that align with user needs and preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage of Instagram Threads should meet the following criteria:

1. **Functionality:** The core features of thread posting, commenting, liking, and sharing must be fully functional. Users should be able to easily post threads, interact with other users' threads, and share threads with their followers.

2. **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly. Users should be able to easily navigate the app, understand how to use each feature, and perform actions without encountering errors or difficulties.

3. **Performance:** The app should load quickly and perform smoothly, even under heavy usage. Thread posting and loading times should be minimal to ensure a seamless user experience.

4. **Reliability:** The app should be stable and reliable, with minimal downtime or bugs. Any issues that arise should be quickly identified and resolved.

## Success Metrics

Success for Instagram Threads can be defined by several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

1. **User Engagement:** This includes metrics like the number of threads posted, likes, comments, and shares. These metrics indicate how actively users are using and interacting with the feature. High user engagement suggests that users find the feature valuable and engaging.

2. **User Growth:** This includes metrics like the number of new users and the rate of user growth. These metrics indicate how well the feature is attracting new users. High user growth suggests that the feature is appealing to potential users and effective at attracting them to the platform.

3. **User Retention:** This includes metrics like the number of active users and the user retention rate. These metrics indicate how well the feature is retaining existing users. High user retention suggests that users continue to find value in the feature over time.

4. **Revenue:** If Instagram decides to implement sponsored threads, revenue from these sponsored threads would be a key success metric. High revenue suggests that advertisers find the feature valuable and effective at reaching their target audience.

These KPIs matter because they provide quantifiable measures of the feature's success. They indicate how well the feature is meeting its objectives of increasing user engagement, attracting new users, retaining existing users, and potentially generating revenue.

These KPIs can be used to make the product better by identifying areas for improvement. For example, if user engagement is low, Instagram might need to make the feature more engaging or easier to use. If user growth is slow, Instagram might need to do more to promote the feature or make it more appealing to potential users. If user retention is low, Instagram might need to do more to keep users interested in the feature over time. If revenue is low, Instagram might need to make the feature more attractive to advertisers.
